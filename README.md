# Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and severe primary brain tumour in adults with the worst prognosis despite numerous attempts to improve patient survival. While gene expression deregulation in GBM was widely noted, key mechanisms driving overexpression of genes in GBM remain largely unknown. The initiation of transcription in open chromatin is driven by a class of DNA-binding proteins known as transcription factors (TFs) and understanding how crucial TFs-gene regulatory networks operate may reveal critical routes of gliomagenesis. We present herein the in silico prediction and experimental identification of TF binding sites in the ATAC-seq data from human LN18 and LN229 glioma cells as well as in glioblastoma tissues. We investigated various datasets that include DNA methylation, histone acetylation (H3K27ac), transcriptomics profiles from gliomas, and the Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. The comparative analyses of those profiles in gliomas of different malignancy grades revealed the importance of the transcription factor c-Jun in GBMs. We show that c-Jun may control the transcription of the overexpressed genes such as VIM, FOSL2 or UPP1, by binding to their  promoters. Furthermore, we found that in the majority of c-Jun targets, DNA methylation plays an important role in the c-Jun-dependent regulation. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay we demonstrated that the VIMENTIN gene is regulated by c-Jun. We present the transcriptional landscape of glioblastomas compared to benign gliomas and  key transcription factors potentially driving gliomagenesis.
