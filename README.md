# Abstract
Despite numerous attempts to improve patient survival, glioblastoma, the most common and severe primary brain tumor in adults, persists to have the worst prognosis. The initiation of transcription, which is mostly regulated by a class of DNA-binding proteins known as transcription factors, is the major checkpoint in gene expression regulation. Despite significant efforts, the specific regulation of genes overexpressed in glioblastomas remains largely unknown. A better understanding of events occurring in the open chromatin regions in HGGs is crucial to comprehend routes of brain cancer progression. We present herein the in silico identification of transcription factor binding sites in ATAC-seq data in human LN18 and LN229 glioma cells as well as in glioblastoma tissues. In order to better understand the specific TF regulation, we investigated various datasets that included DNA methylation profiles, histone acetylation (H3K27ac) profiles, glioblastoma cell transcriptomics profiles, and the Cancer Genome Atlas datasets.We and explored different datasets that comprise DNA methylation profiles, histone acetylation (H3K27ac) profiles, glioblastoma cell transcriptomics profiles and the Cancer Genome Atlas datasets in order to better understand the specific TF regulation. The comparative analyses of those profiles in gliomas of different malignancy grades revealed the importance of the transcription factor c-Jun, which may play a role in the regulation of overexpressed genes in glioblastoma such as VIM, FOSL2 or UPP1, by binding to their gene promoters. Furthermore, we found that in the majority of c-Jun gene targets, DNA methylation plays an important role in the c-Jun dependent regulation. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed an unknown regulation of the Vimentin gene by c-Jun. These findings establish the transcriptional landscape of glioblastomas when compared to benign gliomas, and the identification of potentially key transcription factors driving tumorigenesis in glioblastomas may pave the way for potential future treatments of malignant gliomas.
